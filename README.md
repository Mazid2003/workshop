# 🛠️ Workshop on Artificial Intelligence & Cyber Security

I recently attended a workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security, where I gained hands-on experience with various AI and cybersecurity tools. The key takeaways from the 
workshop include:

🔹 Developing a Telegram Bot using APIs for automation and real-time interactions.

🔹 Building Machine Learning Models using Roboflow, a powerful platform for dataset management and model training.

🔹 Exploring AI-powered Video Generation Tools for creating dynamic and engaging content.

🔹 Implementing Real-Time Object Detection using an AI-based website for enhanced computer vision applications.

This workshop provided valuable insights into AI development, cybersecurity, and real-world applications of machine learning. Looking forward to applying these learnings to future projects! 🚀

Would love to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals on AI and cybersecurity innovations. Feel free to check out my GitHub for more projects!
